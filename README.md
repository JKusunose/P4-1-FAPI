# P4-1-FAPI
 Flash-angles pulse inversion imaging for P4-1 transducer (P4-1FAPI)
 
 **Description:**
   This is a multi-angle plane-wave ultrasound contrast-imaging sequence specifically written and optimized for the P4-1 phased array transducer to be operated on the Verasonics Vantage Research Ultrasound System. The sequence is based upon the Flash-angles method, a plane-wave imaging method with multiple steering angles provided by Verasonics. Pulse-inversion was implemented onto the Flash-angles method to achieve contrast imaging, and variables were empirically optimized for microbubble imaging.
